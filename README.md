# Student Information & Management System

This Project was basically on a system that is developed for a University to save the data of students in records and manage that records and allow students to access this system for checking their information.

THE PROBLEM:
- First problem was that data of students was saved on papers that is not too secure and also had more chance to be damaged.
- Second the legacy system had poor user interface
- Third problem was that student visits admin office again and again to check their information, that is a big problem for student.
